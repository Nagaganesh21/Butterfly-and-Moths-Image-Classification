# Butterfly & Moths Species Classification

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Butterfly & Moths Species Classification project! This project involves creating an image classifier using computer vision techniques to accurately classify images of various Butterfly & Moths species. Python and deep learning libraries will be employed to develop a custom classification model.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing a diverse collection of Butterfly & Moths images, encompassing various species. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the image classifier.

## Project Tasks

In this project, We Did:

1. **Data Exploration**: Dive into the dataset to gain insights into its composition and structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for model training by addressing data quality issues, resizing images, and implementing data augmentation as necessary.

3. **Model Development**: Build a custom deep learning model for image classification, experimenting with different architectures and techniques to achieve high accuracy.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Train and rigorously evaluate the image classifier on the dataset, measuring its performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project is to create an accurate and efficient image classifier capable of distinguishing between different Butterfly & Moths species. The successful completion of this task can have applications in biodiversity studies, ecological research, and image recognition.
